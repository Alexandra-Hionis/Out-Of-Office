# Out-Of-Office

## Description
 Sometimes working for a large company can make it hard to make new friends and expand your social network. Many company events get sent down a long email chain and lack fun interaction. That's where Out of Office comes in! Out of Office enables employees to create a post for an after-work event. Other employees, who log in with their employee email addresses, can search, join, or create events. It is a Node application using an Express server and Handlebars.js as the template engine. It is backed by a MySQL database with a Sequelize ORM. Passport is also included for login and password creation. It follows the MVC paradigm and utilizes both GET and POST routes. Lastly is has a fun, polished front end/UI.
